# üñ•Ô∏è Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Design Project

This project follows the **HCI design process** to create and test a functional prototype. Each stage of the design thinking framework was carefully applied to ensure usability, accessibility, and a user-centered experience.

## üìå Design Process

The project was developed using the **five key stages** of the design thinking approach:

![HCI Process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mariyam2212/grocery-lister/master/images/design-process.png)


1. **Empathize**

   * Conducted user research and gathered insights into user needs, goals, and pain points.
   * Used interviews and surveys to understand the target audience.

2. **Define**

   * Created a problem statement based on findings.
   * Identified core challenges and opportunities.

3. **Ideate**

   * Brainstormed multiple solutions and design approaches.
   * Sketched possible user interface layouts and interaction flows.

4. **Prototype**

   * Developed an interactive prototype using Figma.
   * Focused on intuitive navigation and aesthetic consistency.

5. **Test**

   * Conducted usability testing with real users.
   * Collected feedback and iterated on the design.
